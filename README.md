# Lift_Controller
Elevators, integral to modern urban life, have evolved from simple mechanical systems to sophisticated, digitally-driven entities.

The objective is clear: to seamlessly integrate advanced software solutions into the elevator control domain. By delving into the intricacies of software design and synthesis, this project aligns with the trajectory of elevators as intelligent, digital entities poised to redefine standards in vertical transportation. The synthesis phase, facilitated by Cadence tools, not only provides quantitative insights into system performance but also serves as a compass for optimization and refinement.
